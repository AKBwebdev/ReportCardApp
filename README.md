#### Project Overview
The goal was to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Java Class which would allow a school to store a studentâ€™s grades for a particular year. 

The custom Java class takes Student Name, Teacher Name, Student Year, Subjects, Marks, and a Special Message as inputs to prepare the report, validates and sanitizes data where appropriate and outputs report.

Validations performed by the class are as follows:
<ul>
     <li>Checks if an input name contain characters other than a-z, A-Z, space and '.
             If it does, then removes those characters, and converts name to Title Case.</li>
     <li>Checks if Student Year is between 1 and 13; if not it sets year to 1.</li>
     <li>Checks if a Subject contains characters other than a-z, A-Z and space.
             If it does, then removes those characters.</li>
     <li>Checks if any input marks are less than 0 or greater than 100, in which case
             it sets marks to 0.</li>
</ul><br />
